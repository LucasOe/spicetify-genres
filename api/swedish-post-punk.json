{"pageProps":{"genreid":"swedish-post-punk","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"swedish-post-punk","name":"swedish post-punk","description":"Swedish post-punk emerged in the late 1970s as a response to the commercialization of punk rock. It is characterized by its dark, brooding sound and introspective lyrics, often dealing with themes of alienation and despair. The music is typically driven by bass-heavy rhythms and angular guitar lines, with sparse, atmospheric production.","playlists":["0spsvp2NNHMXDezns2YSGt"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
