{"pageProps":{"genreid":"italian-bass","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"italian-bass","name":"italian bass","description":"This music genre is all about the low end. It features heavy, booming basslines that drive the rhythm and create a powerful, visceral energy. The bass is often accompanied by sparse percussion and atmospheric synths or samples. The sound is dark and moody, with a focus on deep grooves and hypnotic repetition.","playlists":["4nnzdeauDrOZv9WWKLctcl"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
