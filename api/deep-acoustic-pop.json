{"pageProps":{"genreid":"deep-acoustic-pop","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"deep-acoustic-pop","name":"deep acoustic pop","description":"\"Deep acoustic pop\" is a genre that combines the catchy hooks and emotional lyrics of pop music with the raw, organic sound of acoustic instruments. Songs in this genre often feature guitar or piano accompaniment, and may incorporate elements of folk or country music. The stripped-down instrumentation allows for a greater focus on the vocals and lyrics, resulting in a more intimate and emotional listening experience.","playlists":["0i65yM4zM45UzL6X54UYBP","3qrMkjfQMyOGR9Ay9SRc90"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
