{"pageProps":{"genreid":"swiss-singer-songwriter","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"swiss-singer-songwriter","name":"swiss singer-songwriter","description":"Swiss singer-songwriter is a genre of music that showcases the talents of Swiss musicians who write and perform their own songs. The music is often introspective, with lyrics that touch on personal experiences and emotions. The sound is typically acoustic, with a focus on the singer's voice and the melody of the guitar or piano. Swiss singer-songwriters often draw inspiration from folk, pop, and indie genres, creating a sound that is both intimate and relatable.","playlists":["39fDLM4s1IyMlxDLLRFpkX"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
