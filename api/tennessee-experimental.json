{"pageProps":{"genreid":"tennessee-experimental","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"tennessee-experimental","name":"tennessee experimental","description":"Tennessee Experimental music is a genre that is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in music. It is characterized by its use of unconventional instruments, experimental production techniques, and a willingness to take risks and explore new sounds. Bands in this genre often incorporate elements of noise, ambient, and electronic music to create a sound that is both challenging and rewarding. Tennessee Experimental is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are willing to explore the outer edges of music.","playlists":["2yZaGhmtFyRYuCHG8P2hyX"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
