{"pageProps":{"genreid":"classical-era","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"classical-era","name":"classical era","description":"The classical era in music is a period that spans roughly from the mid-18th century to the early 19th century. It is characterized by its emphasis on clarity, balance, and symmetry, and is often associated with the music of composers such as Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. The classical era is known for its use of orchestral instruments, such as the piano, violin, and cello, and for its focus on melody and harmony rather than on complex musical structures.","playlists":["4HAbdPTjKgU8GUHRsaCxSU","0Fzw8vOyyPx9JoBaUAZzdP"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
