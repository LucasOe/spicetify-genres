{"pageProps":{"genreid":"classical-countertenor","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"classical-countertenor","name":"classical countertenor","description":"Classical countertenor is a type of male singing voice that is high and ethereal in tone. It is often associated with early music and baroque opera, and is characterized by its delicate and otherworldly quality. Countertenors are able to sing in a range that is similar to that of female sopranos, but with a distinct and unique sound that is all their own.","playlists":["1QzYdN21I99ZaGL4USSVBv","4n4Raho5vf7bWXC4c1Yu8w"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
