{"pageProps":{"genreid":"spoken-word","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"spoken-word","name":"spoken word","description":"Spoken word is a form of performance poetry that emphasizes the spoken word over traditional poetic elements such as rhyme and meter. It often involves the use of storytelling, humor, and social commentary to engage and challenge the audience. Spoken word performances are typically accompanied by music or sound effects, and may incorporate elements of theater and improvisation. This genre has its roots in the African-American oral tradition and has since spread to become a global movement.","playlists":["7BvhYqKX9xCjKKkvsiowo3"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
