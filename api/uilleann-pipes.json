{"pageProps":{"genreid":"uilleann-pipes","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"uilleann-pipes","name":"uilleann pipes","description":"Uilleann pipes are a traditional Irish instrument that is often used in Celtic music. They are similar to bagpipes, but are played using a bellows instead of blowing into a bag. The sound is haunting and melancholic, and is often used to create a mournful or reflective atmosphere in music. The uilleann pipes are often accompanied by other traditional Irish instruments such as the fiddle and the bodhran.","playlists":["71iQR4AeEIQgaiVsBJBghh","55ueCrxficEhcdS4Jpl9pe"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
