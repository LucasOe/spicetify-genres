{"pageProps":{"genreid":"lowercase","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"lowercase","name":"lowercase","description":"Lowercase is an experimental music genre that emerged in the early 2000s. It is characterized by very quiet and minimalistic sounds, often created using field recordings, found objects, and acoustic instruments. Lowercase music is intended to be listened to at low volumes and can be described as meditative and introspective. It is often associated with the concept of \"microsound\" and is popular among fans of ambient and avant-garde music.","playlists":["0X48ayqAs9PQ2Z4wRe2YBb","1YmeYaaH8dzlecm3u5tMot"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
