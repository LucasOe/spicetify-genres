{"pageProps":{"genreid":"tucson-indie","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"tucson-indie","name":"tucson indie","description":"Tucson indie is a genre of alternative rock music that originated in Tucson, Arizona. It is characterized by its use of lo-fi production techniques and a DIY ethos. The music often features jangly guitars, introspective lyrics, and a laid-back, desert-inspired vibe. Many Tucson indie bands have gained a cult following in recent years, thanks in part to the city's vibrant music scene.","playlists":["5o1AJTX1chQYFF0xHVgL0f"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
