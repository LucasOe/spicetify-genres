{"pageProps":{"genreid":"kansas-indie","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"kansas-indie","name":"kansas indie","description":"Kansas indie is a subgenre of indie rock that originated in Kansas. It is characterized by its lo-fi production, introspective lyrics, and use of unconventional instruments, such as banjos, accordions, and mandolins. The sound is heavily influenced by folk, country, and blues, and is known for its stripped-down, DIY aesthetic. The lyrics often touch on themes of love, loss, and nostalgia, and are delivered in a soft, haunting style.","playlists":["546dyL0xeFMd4eDVT9bE7m"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
