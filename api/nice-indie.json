{"pageProps":{"genreid":"nice-indie","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"nice-indie","name":"nice indie","description":"Nice indie - Nice indie is a subgenre of indie rock that is characterized by its mellow, laid-back sound. Its music often features acoustic guitars, soft vocals, and introspective lyrics that explore themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. Nice indie is perfect for relaxing after a long day or for creating a cozy atmosphere during a rainy day. Some popular nice indie artists include Iron & Wine, Bon Iver, and Fleet Foxes.","playlists":["6JaSAyveY1kLiR9pLew571"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
