{"pageProps":{"genreid":"indie-singer-songwriter","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"indie-singer-songwriter","name":"indie singer-songwriter","description":"Indie singer-songwriter is a genre that originated in the 1960s and 1970s and is characterized by intimate, personal lyrics and acoustic instrumentation. The focus is on the singer-songwriter as a storyteller, and the songs often deal with themes such as love, loss, and self-discovery. The genre has evolved over time, and today's indie singer-songwriters often incorporate elements of other genres such as pop, rock, and folk.","playlists":["2bufHEzNYhC6tl3zpvXG7l"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
