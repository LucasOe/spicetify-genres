{"pageProps":{"genreid":"modern-free-jazz","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"modern-free-jazz","name":"modern free jazz","description":"A subgenre of jazz that emphasizes improvisation and experimentation, modern free jazz is characterized by its unconventional rhythms, harmonies, and instrumentation. It emerged in the 1950s as a response to the limitations of traditional jazz and has since become a platform for musicians to push the boundaries of what is possible in music. Its lack of structure and emphasis on spontaneity can make it challenging for some listeners, but for others, it is a thrilling and exhilarating experience.","playlists":["4g8jY2NYAlj7sBdFHtrgdF"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
