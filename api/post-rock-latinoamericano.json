{"pageProps":{"genreid":"post-rock-latinoamericano","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"post-rock-latinoamericano","name":"post-rock latinoamericano","description":"Post-rock latinoamericano is a subgenre of post-rock that originated in Latin America during the early 2000s. It is characterized by its use of traditional Latin American music elements, such as Andean flutes and indigenous percussion, mixed with post-rock instrumentation and song structures. Bands like Sigur Rós and Explosions in the Sky have influenced the development of this genre, which has since produced notable acts like El Mató a un Policía Motorizado and Usted Señálemelo.","playlists":["7wiuy5iEdMLPlkxAZ1Xag6"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
