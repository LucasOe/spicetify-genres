{"pageProps":{"genreid":"okinawan-folk","genresAdvancedInfo":{"id":"okinawan-folk","name":"okinawan folk","description":"Okinawan folk is a traditional music style from the Ryukyu Islands, located in the southernmost part of Japan. It is characterized by its use of the sanshin, a three-stringed instrument similar to a banjo, and its distinctive vocal style, which features a high-pitched, nasal tone. Okinawan folk songs often tell stories of love, loss, and everyday life, and are accompanied by traditional dance and costumes.","playlists":["6QpABgocYI5MBTYd9VTAa0","5nQvo3a0amD3Gp0aYhaRN0"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
