It is characterized by a group of four male singers who use their voices to create harmonies and overtones that mimic the sounds of instruments. The lead singer, or \"contra,\" sings the melody while the other three singers provide the drone, bass, and high harmonies.","playlists":["0Pg8lDo46YYTaEAdiskop8"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
