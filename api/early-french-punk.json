It was heavily influenced by British punk rock but also incorporated elements of French chanson and yé-yé music. Early French punk bands often sang in French and addressed social and political issues. The genre was short-lived but had a significant impact on French music and culture.","playlists":["1W3oo9Lkf6svTwBfijAQdK"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
