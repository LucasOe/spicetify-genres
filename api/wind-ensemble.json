The group is typically smaller than a full orchestra and focuses on creating a cohesive sound through the use of wind instruments. Wind ensembles often play classical and contemporary music and are popular in school and community settings. The group is led by a conductor who directs the musicians and ensures that the music is played in a synchronized manner.","playlists":["3cANCffSWFKbBFnMpDmsnj"]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
