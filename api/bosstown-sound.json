These bands were heavily influenced by the British psychedelic movement, but also incorporated elements of folk and blues into their music. The term \"Bosstown sound\" was coined by a record executive in an attempt to create a new scene in Boston, but the movement ultimately failed to gain widespread attention.","playlists":[]},"messages":{"index":{"heading":"Your Spotify Stats","intro-first-line":"Get statistics about your top artists, songs, and genres from Spotify.","intro-second-line":"Updated daily.
